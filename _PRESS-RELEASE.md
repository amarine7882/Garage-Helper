## Sub-Heading

Mechanic Helper is a new tool for both professional and enthusiast mechanics to keep track of maintenance and make working
on your vehicle easier.

## Summary

Mechanic Helper keeps track of your maintenance schedules for you and then reminds you when its time to perform them. You can pick from recommended maintenance or create any custom task and schedule.

When you're working on your vehicle, Mechanic Helper will be your smart assistant. You can tell it to add a part to your wish list, or ask it specifications for the part your working on so you dont have to touch your manual.

## Problem

This assistant was designed with mechanics in mind. Keeping track of many regular maintenance intervals on many cars is a pain. Now you can set it and forget it until its time to get it done.

Mechanic Helper also solves the problem of endlessly needing to go back and forth to your manual to write down parts you need or look up how to work on a part.

## Solution

Mechanic Helper lets you add cars to your virtual garage. You can pick from a list of cars with pre made schedules, or you can create your very own custom list. When it comes time to perform the task, Mechanic Helper will email you to let you know to perform your maintenance.

When it comes time to work on your vehicle, you can set up a list of numbers (such as torque settings) or anything else you need ahead of time. And then when you're working on your car, you can ask your google assistant to tell you anything from that list.

I used to hate keeping track of all of my unique maintenance for my older sports car, and when it came time to work on it, constantly getting out from under it to reference the manual was very frustrating. Now that I use Mechanic Helper, those tasks could never be easier.
